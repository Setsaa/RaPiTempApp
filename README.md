# RaPiTemperatureApp
An application I made for Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT that monitors the temperature and air humidity.

# Features:

- Monitor temperature, air pressure and humidity locally
- Displays real-time information to the Sense HAT's LED matrix
- Quick-glance feature for making sure the meausurements are normal
- Email alert when the readings are extreme or when action is required
- (In development) Local web client to monitor temperature on more devices
- (In development) Extended network of RaPi devices to monitor information in more rooms
- (Future plans) Giving the code physical access to temperature controls to automate corrections
- (Future plans) Web-based client to check meausurements from anywhere and access temperature controls remotely
